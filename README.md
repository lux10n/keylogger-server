# Keylogger-server
Just a little project about create a keylogger and send it to another machine using a simple http server

# Special thanks 
Thanks to @lux10n the idea and the code

# How it works 
1. there are two files ( client and server )
2. Client using to run the keylogger, put the keystrokes in a file keylogger.txt and send it to a http server using post method
3. Server just for create a simple http server using #Flask to receive the keylogger.txt file
